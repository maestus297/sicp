When we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas.

• primitive expressions , which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,
• means of combination , by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
• means of abstraction , by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.
